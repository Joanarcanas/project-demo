        <h2>Pet Adoption</h2>
        <p>Pet adoption is taking a pet home in order to provide shelter for them. 
            Just like humans, pet have the right to a better home, medical care, food and love. 
            Our aim is to provide homeless pets in particular cats a home to stay in. 
            A home and owners where they will feel loved and treasured. 
            To protect animals is to protect life. 
            This reduces the number of stray pets in the streets. </p>
